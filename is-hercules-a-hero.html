Phaistos then refused to do anything of the kind, but insisted on sacrificing to him as a god. Even at the present day the Sikyonians, after slaying a lamb and burning the thighs upon the altar, eat some of the meat as part of a victim given to a god, while the rest they offer as to a hero.

Molorkhos wanted to make an animal sacrifice, but Herakles told him to hold off for thirty days, and then, if he returned safe from the hunt, to sacrifice to Zeus Soter (Saviour), but if he were dead, to sacrifice to Herakles himself as a hero . . .<br />[After slaying the lion :] He then draped it over his shoulders and took it back to Kleonai.

The attitude of the image is due, they say, to the fight with Hippokoon and his sons. The enmity of Herakles towards the family of Hippokoon is said to have sprung out of their refusing to cleanse him when he came to Sparta for cleansing after the death of Iphitos.<br />The following incident, too, helped to begin the feud. Oionos, a stripling cousin of Herakles--he was the son of Likymnios the brother of Alkmene--came to Sparta along with Herakles, and went round to view the city. When he came to the house of Hippokoon, a house-dog attacked him. Oionos happened to throw a stone which knocked over the dog. So the sons of Hippokoon ran out, and dispatched Oionos with their clubs.<br />This made Herakles most bitterly wroth with Hippokoon and his sons, and straightway, angry as he was, he set out to give them battle. On this occasion he was wounded, and made good his retreat by stealth but afterwards he made an expedition against Sparta and succeeded in avenging himself on Hippokoon, and also on the sons of Hippokoon for their murder of Oionos.

In this gymnasium the athletes are wont to go through the training through which they must pass before going to Olympia. High plane-trees grow between the tracks inside a wall. The whole of this enclosure is called Xystos, because an exercise of Herakles, the son of Amphitryon, was to scrape up (anaxuein) each day all the thistles that grew there . . . There are also in the gymnasium [of Elis] altars of the gods, of Herakles Idaios, surnamed Parastates (Comrade), of Eros (Love), of the deity called by Eleans and Athenians alike Anteros (Love Returned).'</p><p><span>Pausanias, Description of Greece 6. 23. 5 :</span><br />'There is also a third enclosed gymnasium, called Maltho from the softness of its floor, and reserved for the youths for the whole time of the festival.

He was descended from Herakles Idaios; he held the games at Olympia and set up an altar in honor of Heracles, his ancestor, and the other Kouretes, giving to Heracles the surname of Parastates (Assistant).'</p><p><span>Pausanias, Description of Greece 5. 14. 7 :</span><br />'After this [several altars near the start of the chariot racecourse] stands an altar of Herakles surnamed Parastates (Assistant); there are also altars of the brothers of Herakles--Epimedes, Idas, Paionaios, and Iasus; I am aware, however, that the altar of Idas is called by others the altar of Akesidas.'</p><p><span>Pausanias, Description of Greece 5. 14. 9 :</span><br />'Near the treasury of the Sikyonians is an altar of Herakles, either one of the Kouretes or the son of Alkmena, for both accounts are given.'</p><p><span>Pausanias, Description of Greece 5. 4. 6 :</span><br />'At this time [i.e. during the mythical return of the Herakleides to the Peloponnese] Greece was grievously worn by internal strife and plague, and it occurred to Iphitos [grandson of the Trojan War hero Thoas] to ask the god at Delphoi for deliverance from these evils. The story goes that the Pythian priestess ordained that Iphitos himself and the Eleans must renew the Olympic games. Iphitos also induced the Eleans to sacrifice to Herakles as to a god, whom hitherto they had looked upon as their enemy. The inscription at Olympia calls Iphitos the son of Haemon, but most of the Greeks say that his father was Praxonides and not Haemon, while the ancient records of Elis traced him to a father of the same name.'</p><p><span>Pausanias, Description of Greece 5. 7. 7 :</span><br />'Herakles, being the eldest [of the Daktyloi], matched his brothers, as a game, in a running-race, and crowned the winner with a branch of wild olive, of which they had such a copious supply that they slept on heaps of its leaves while still green. It is said to have been introduced into Greece by Herakles from the land of the Hyperboreans, men living beyond the home of the North Wind.' [N.B. Herakles son of Zeus and Herakles the Daktylos are synonymous here.]</p><p><span>Pausanias, Description of Greece 5. 8. 2 :</span><br />'Augeas too held them [the Olympic Games], and likewise Herakles, the son of Amphitryon, after the conquest of Elis. The victors crowned by Herakles include Iolaos, who won with the mares of Herakles . . . Of Herakles himself it is said that he won victories at wrestling and the pancratium.'</p><p><span>Pausanias, Description of Greece 5. 10. 9 :</span><br />'Most of the labours of Herakles are represented at Olympia [on one of the pediments of the temple of Zeus Olympios]. Above the doors of the temple is carved the hunting of the Arkadian boar, his exploit against Diomedes the Thrakian, and that against Geryones at Erytheia; he is also about to receive the burden of Atlas, and he cleanses the land from dung for the Eleans. Above the doors of the rear chamber he is taking the girdle from the Amazon; and there are the affairs of the deer, of the bull at Knossos, of the Stymphalian birds, of the Hydra, and of the Argive lion.'</p><p><span>Pausanias, Description of Greece 5. 13. 1 :</span><br />'The sanctuary [Pelopion at Olympia] is said to have been set apart to Pelops by Herakles the son of Amphitryon. Herakles too was a great-grandson of Pelops, and he is also said to have sacrificed to him into the pit. Right down to the present day the magistrates of the year sacrifice to him, and the victim is a black ram. No portion of this sacrifice goes to the sooth-sayer, only the neck of the ram it is usual to give to the 'woodman,' as he is called.'</p><p><span>Pausanias, Description of Greece 5. 13. 8 :</span><br />'The altar of Zeus Olympios is about equally distant from the Pelopion (Temple of Pelops) and the sanctuary of Hera, but it is in front of both. Some say that it was built by Herakles Idaios, others by the local heroes two generations later than Herakles. It has been made from the ash of the thighs of the victims sacrificed to Zeus.'</p><p><span>Pausanias, Description of Greece 5. 14. 1 - 2 :</span><br />'The [great] altar [of Zeus] at Olympia shows another strange peculiarity, which is this. The kite, the bird of prey with the most rapacious nature, never harms those who are sacrificing at Olympia. Should ever a kite seize the entrails or some of the flesh, it is regarded as an unfavorable sign for the sacrificer. There is a story that when Herakles the son of Alkmena was sacrificing at Olympia he was much worried by the flies. So either on his own initiative or at somebody's suggestion he sacrificed to Zeus Averter of Flies, and thus the flies were diverted to the other side of the Alpheios. It is said that in the same way the Eleans too sacrifice to Zeus Averter of Flies, to drive1 the flies out of Olympia.<br />The Eleans are wont to use for the sacrifices to Zeus the wood of the white poplar and of no other tree, preferring the white poplar, I think, simply and solely because Herakles brought it into Greece from Thesprotia. And it is my opinion that when Herakles sacrificed to Zeus at Olympia he himself burned the thigh bones of the victims upon wood of the white poplar. Herakles found the white poplar growing on the banks of the Akheron, the river in Thesprotia.'</p><p><span>Pausanias, Description of Greece 5. 25. 11 :</span><br />'Not far from the offering of the Akhaians [at Olympia] there is also a Herakles fighting with the Amazon, a woman on horseback, for her girdle. It was dedicated by Euagoras, a Zanclaean by descent, and made by Aristokles of Kydonia. Aristokles should be included amongst the most ancient sculptors, and though his date is uncertain, he was clearly born before Zankle took its present name of Messene.<br />The Thasians [of the Greek island of Thasos] . . . dedicated at Olympia a Herakles, the pedestal as well as the image being of bronze. The height of the image is ten cubits, and he holds a club in his right hand and a bow in his left.'</p><p><span>Pausanias, Description of Greece 5. 26. 7 :</span><br />'By the smaller offerings of Mikythos [at Olympia], that were made by Dionysios, are some of the exploits of Herakles, including what he did to the Nemean lion, the Hydra, the Hound of Hell, and the boar by the river Erymanthos. These were brought to Olympia by the people of Herakleia [in Bithynia] when they had overrun the land of the Mariandynians, their foreign neighbors.'</p><p><span>Pausanias, Description of Greece 6. 19. 12 :</span><br />'The Megarians who are neighbors of Attika built a treasury [at Olympia] and dedicated in it offerings, small cedar-wood figures inlaid with gold, representing the fight of Herakles with Akheloos. The figures include Zeus, Deianeira, Akheloos, Herakles, and Ares helping Akheloos.
