after several years of speculation, we finally have actual, official, verbal confirmation from Kevin Fiege himself, that the one and only Fantastic Four will be coming to the MCU.</p><p>Yes, in case you didn't know, on Disney Investor Day, Marvel Studios' President Kevin Feige announced that they have started production on a MCU Fantastic Four Film, set to be part of Marvel's phase 5, which is a bit of a let down since it can't be part of Phase 4, but whatever, it's better than nothing, and better late than never. As far as we know for sure, production has already begun and Jon Watts, director of the MCU Spider-Man films, will also be directing this upcoming Fantastic Four film. And depending on what you think about Jon Watts, this is either a good thing or a bad thing. Many dislike the fact that Jon Watts is directing, claiming that his style of directing is bad quality, despite the clear success and approval of Spider-Man Homecoming and Far From Home, presumably from both audiences and critics alike, I could be wrong. As for me, I don't have a problem with his style of Directing, as I enjoyed both Homecoming and Far From Home, though that might just be because of what he had to work with, if he had notes and pointers from either Kevin Fiege and/or whatever creative team they have at Marvel Studios, or maybe I just have bad taste, either way, I may not have a problem with him, but I understand why others might.</p><p>While Fox struck gold with the 'X-Men' franchise, the studio consistently struggled to get a good version of 'Fantastic Four' off the ground. Fox's first two attempts at 'Fantastic Four' adaptations, starring Jessica Alba, Michael Chiklis, Ioan Gruffudd, and Chris Evans (who later played Captain America in the MCU), were both panned by fans. Marvel chief Kevin Feige dropped the news Thursday (during a Disney investor presentation) that the studio is making a new version of Fantastic Four, after Fox's 2005 version and a panned 2015.</p><p>Anyway, given that all, if not most of us marvel fans are definitely excited and happy about this news of Marvel's first family coming to the MCU. Hopefully they can be done right this time. as many of us know, the last batch of movies were less than acceptable, to say the least. The low budget 90's film was no better than a bollywood film, or any number of loser movies. The first one from the mid 2000's was okay, and then the second from the mid 2000's was definitely downhill, and then the Fant Four film was a total dumpster fire. This may sound like harsh criticism, but I'm confident you all can agree, or at least I hope so. Now is a chance for the studio to do things right, thankfully.</p><p>So, we know very little about the film and it's plot. I don't know the release date, or if it's even been announced, but my best guess is sometime in late 2022, or early 2023, either earlier or later within that time period, depending on how it will all play out with the other MCU releases. AS for the plot and the actors involved, all we have is either nothing, or just speculation. Speculation on the internet suggests that we will probably not get John Krasinski and Emily Blunt as Mr. Fantastic and the Invisible Woman, but instead see new and fresh faces in those roles instead, as it is rumored that Marvel is looking for fresh new faces to star in the film. There is a list of the most likely lesser known actors to get the roles on the internet if you wonder what those are. As for the plot of the film and how exactly they Four will be introduced, we have only educated guesses, with the most popular theory being that they, or Doctor Doom, were in the quantum realm, similar to Janet Van Dyne from the Ant Man films. Or that Reed Richards and the others moved into Avengers Tower to turn it into the Baxter Building, or that they bought it back after having previously resided there long before Stark owned it, as one possible plot has them getting their powers in the 60s, and then getting stuck in the quantum realm because of it.</p><p>Now, all those seem possible, but I am fairly certain marvel won't do that EXACTLY as we theorize, and instead subvert our expectations, as they have done before. And just like before, they will most likely surprise us with something even better than what we've speculated.</p><p>Although, unlike most people on the internet who either believe they have it perfectly figured out or those who think that what they want is the right way to go, no disrespect to anyone on the internet, i'm speaking in general here, I don't have a solid theory on how they will bring in the Fantastic four, and I don't have a specific way I want them to do it. All I have a best guesses, and high hopes, and just ideas that are mere suggestions at best. Now, I don't have a theory on the Fantastic four themselves, although there is one on Doctor Doom that I saw on Youtube that I like and feel is somewhat possible. The theory is that before the Soviet Era in Europe, Sokovia was actually called Latveria, and was called that before the Soviet Union took over, and now after everything that's happened in the world, the country is at it's very worst, and that one man, one genius man who was orphaned after the passing of his sorceress mother and scientist father, comes in to pick up the pieces, and rebuilds his home country to a state that far exceeds its former glory, as he rebuilds Latveria from the ashes. And that man could be none other than Victor Von Doom himself. Whether or not that's how they do it is UNKNOWN, and is 45% likely to happen at the very most.</p><p>As for what I would like the plot to be for an FF movie, I got nothing. However, I just want the chemistry of the team to feel real. I want them to actually resemble a family, especially a dysfunctional family, since that's exactly what the team has always been in the comics. They fight and have arguments, more so then they do with the enemy, arguably speaking, yet they love each other as if they were all bound by blood relation. And so far, every film has pretty much failed, especially the Fant Four film, which was so unrecognizable beyond compare. But I think the studio has it covered this time. 5th time's the charm hopefully. All I'd recommend is just taking inspiration from what the Director of the Ant Man Films had in mind, and to also take inspiration from Fantastic Four World's Greatest Heroes, which is easily one of the greatest tv adaptations of the characters, even though it was sadly short lived. Other than that, there's a question of who the villain should be. As far as I'm concerned, I feel as though Doctor Doom should be saved for later. Doctor Doom is too great a villain to be used just once in a film, but rather is great enough to be featured in several. given how many wonder who will take Thanos' place as the MCU's biggest and baddest, with Kang seemingly in first place, it would make sense for Doctor Doom to be a strong contender for that spot as well. Many call him the 'Darth Vader' of Marvel, despite the fact that he was actually inspiration for him, and not the other way around. Doctor Doom is a tremendous villain. A scientific genius AND powerful sorcerer, as well as a ruler of a foreign nation, who is actually good at his job. Though he's mainly fought the fantastic four, he's grown beyond that, to the point where every hero working together struggled against him, so it would make more sense to save him for later. Best for last, so to speak. But, for starters, the best choice might be Annihilus, the Ruler of the Negative Zone. Now, there's also speculation that the Quatum Realm and the Negative Zone are either one in the same or connected somehow, and that is very likely to be the case, but even then, it would still make sense, even though many still consider Annihilus capable of becoming the next big bad after Thanos, but because all of his villainous achievements pale in comparison, I doubt it. But I still think he can still serve as a villain that we can enjoy. He looks cool, his backstory is cool, and he is the perfect blend of enjoyable and expendable, since he would be a cool villain to watch in a movie, and has an impressive status and power level nonetheless. But if not Annihilus, there's always the Mole Man, since the skrulls are good guys in the movies, and since Ronan the Accuser is dead.</p><p>But, whatever the future holds for Marvel's first family, I feel confident that I will like it, and hopefully the same goes for you too.</p><span><span>© Disney/Marvel Studios</span> Marvel Studios' president Kevin Feige announced a 'Fantastic Four' MCU movie is coming from director Jon Watts.
